AWS Databases Study Guide
TermDefinition
Amazon RDSA managed relational database service provided by AWS that simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of relational databases.
DB InstanceAn isolated database environment in the AWS Cloud, representing a single database server.
DB EngineThe specific relational database software (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) running on a DB Instance.
DB Instance ClassDetermines the compute and memory capacity of a DB Instance, categorizing instances by type (General Purpose, Memory Optimized, etc.) and size.
Availability Zone (AZ)A distinct location within an AWS Region engineered for fault tolerance and low latency connections to other AZs in the same Region.
Multi-AZ DeploymentA configuration where Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains standby replicas of a DB Instance in different AZs for high availability.
Read ReplicaA read-only copy of a DB Instance used to scale read operations and increase availability.
Security GroupA virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to a DB Instance by specifying allowed IP ranges and protocols.
Amazon CloudWatchA monitoring service that collects and tracks metrics from various AWS resources, including RDS, enabling performance monitoring and alerting.
AWS Management ConsoleA web-based interface for managing AWS services, including creating, configuring, and monitoring RDS instances.AWS CLIA command-line tool for interacting with AWS services, including managing RDS instances through scripts and automation.

Short Answer Quiz Answer Key
Amazon RDS offers advantages like simplified management, automated backups, software patching, failure detection and recovery, high availability options, and enhanced security features. This allows users to focus on application development rather than database administration.
On-premises deployments require full management of hardware and software, while EC2 offers scalable computing capacity where AWS manages the hardware. However, EC2 still requires user management of the OS and database software.
The shared responsibility model divides responsibilities between AWS and the user. AWS manages the underlying infrastructure, operating system, and database software updates. The user is responsible for database security configuration, query optimization, and application-level management.
A DB instance class defines the compute and memory resources allocated to a DB instance. Factors to consider include workload demands, performance requirements, and cost optimization. Different instance classes cater to various needs like general purpose, memory optimization, and compute optimization.
General Purpose (SSD) storage is cost-effective and suitable for diverse workloads, while Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) offers higher performance with consistent I/O throughput, ideal for I/O-intensive applications.
An AWS Region represents a geographical area containing multiple Availability Zones. Deploying RDS instances across regions enhances data redundancy, disaster recovery capabilities, and provides low latency access to users in different locations.
Multi-AZ deployments enhance availability by automatically provisioning standby replicas in different Availability Zones. This ensures automatic failover in case of primary instance failure, minimizes downtime, and enables data redundancy.
Security Groups act as virtual firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to RDS instances. They allow you to define rules based on IP addresses, protocols, and ports, restricting access and enhancing the overall security posture.
Amazon CloudWatch provides metrics and alarms for monitoring RDS performance, enabling tracking of key metrics like CPU utilization, database connections, and query latency. Additionally, Amazon RDS Performance Insights analyzes database load and identifies performance bottlenecks.
Amazon RDS offers multiple user interfaces: the AWS Management Console, a web-based GUI, the AWS CLI for command-line interactions, and the Amazon RDS API for programmatic access and automation.
