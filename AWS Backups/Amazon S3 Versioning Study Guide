Amazon S3 Versioning Study Guide
Glossary of Key Terms
TermDefinition
S3 Versioning A feature of Amazon S3 that allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket.
Version ID A unique identifier assigned to each version of an object.
Delete Marker A special object version that indicates an object has been deleted.
Unversioned Bucket A bucket where versioning is not enabled.Versioning-Enabled BucketA bucket where versioning is enabled, meaning all objects are versioned.
Versioning-Suspended Bucket A bucket where versioning was previously enabled but has been suspended, meaning new objects are not versioned but old versions are retained.
S3 Lifecycle A feature that allows you to define rules for automatically managing the lifecycle of objects in your buckets, such as transitioning them to different storage classes or deleting them after a certain period.

Short Answer Quiz Answer Key
Enabling versioning in Amazon S3 allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket, providing protection against accidental deletion or overwrites and facilitating data recovery.
When you delete an object in a versioning-enabled bucket, a delete marker is inserted instead of permanently removing the object. This marker signifies the object's deletion, but previous versions remain accessible.
An unversioned bucket has versioning disabled by default, meaning only the current version of an object is retained. A versioning-suspended bucket had versioning enabled previously, but it has been paused. Existing object versions are preserved, but new objects are not versioned.
In a versioning-suspended bucket, existing object versions remain unchanged. However, new objects added to the bucket are not versioned and only the latest version is maintained.
Versioning increases storage costs as each version of an object is stored and charged as a separate object. Having multiple versions of objects leads to higher storage consumption and expenses.
The version ID "null" indicates that an object was stored in the bucket before versioning was enabled. These objects retain their null version ID even after versioning is activated.
Using S3 Versioning with S3 Lifecycle allows for comprehensive data retention management. You can define rules to automatically transition object versions to different storage classes or delete them after a specific period, optimizing storage costs and data retention policies.
No, once a bucket is version-enabled, it cannot revert to an unversioned state. However, you can suspend versioning to stop creating new object versions while preserving existing ones.
When multiple write requests are received simultaneously for the same object in a versioning-enabled bucket, Amazon S3 stores all the submitted object versions, ensuring no data is lost.
The SOAP API does not support S3 Versioning.
