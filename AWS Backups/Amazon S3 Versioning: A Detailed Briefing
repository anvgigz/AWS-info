Amazon S3 Versioning: A Detailed Briefing
This document summarizes key information about Amazon S3 Versioning based on the provided source.

What is S3 Versioning?
S3 Versioning is a feature that allows you to keep multiple versions of the same object within an S3 bucket. This enables you to:

Preserve and retrieve previous versions of objects.
Recover from accidental deletions or overwrites.
Protect against application failures.
"With versioning you can recover more easily from both unintended user actions and application failures."

How does S3 Versioning work?
When enabled, S3 assigns a unique version ID to every object, even those existing before versioning was activated.
Deleting an object doesn't permanently remove it. Instead, a "delete marker" is created as the current version.
Overwriting an object creates a new version while preserving the older ones.
You can restore any previous version of an object.
Enabling and Suspending Versioning
Versioning is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled at the bucket level.
Once enabled, a bucket cannot revert to an unversioned state, but you can suspend versioning.
Suspending versioning stops the creation of new object versions but doesn't affect existing ones.
Versioning States
Buckets exist in one of three versioning states:

Unversioned: The default state where no versions are tracked.
Versioning-enabled: All objects are versioned, including existing ones upon modification.
Versioning-suspended: New versions are not created, but existing versions remain accessible.
Cost Implications
Each version of an object is stored and charged as a separate object.
Three versions of an object will incur charges for three objects.
Working with Lifecycle Policies
S3 Versioning can be used in conjunction with S3 Lifecycle policies to manage data retention and storage costs.
Lifecycle policies can be configured to automatically transition or delete specific object versions based on age or other criteria.
Limitations
The SOAP API does not support S3 Versioning.
Key Takeaways
S3 Versioning is a powerful tool for data protection and recovery.
Understanding the different versioning states and their implications is crucial.
Combining versioning with lifecycle policies allows for granular control over data retention and cost optimization.
